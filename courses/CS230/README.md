# Draw It or Lose It


## The Gaming Room - Software Design Document Reflection

This document reflects on the software design document created for the client, The Gaming Room.

### Client and Software Requirements Summary

The client, The Gaming Room, is a game developer looking to expand the reach of their existing Android game, "Draw It or Lose It." Their primary requirement was the design of a web-based, multi-platform version of this game. Key software requirements included:

* Support for one or more teams per game instance.
* Each team must accommodate multiple players.
* Unique names for games and teams, with a mechanism to check for name availability.
* Ensuring only one instance of a game exists in memory at any given time.

The goal was to increase their customer base and revenue by making the game accessible on various platforms beyond just Android.

### Strengths in Documentation Development

In developing this software design document, I believe I excelled in clearly articulating the system's architecture and data design. I focused on creating descriptions that effectively conveyed how the different components of the web-based game would interact and how the crucial data (games, teams, players) would be structured and managed.

### Area for Revision and Improvement

If I could revise one part of the documentation, it would be the design constraints. While the requirements were outlined, providing more detailed descriptions of the design constraints within the document would have been beneficial. I would improve this by providing

### Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on the core functionality of the original "Draw It or Lose It" game and how that needed to translate to a multi-platform web environment. This involved ensuring the design accounted for the team-based gameplay, player participation, and the need for unique identifiers for game elements, as these were fundamental to the user's experience of the game.

### Approach to Software Design and Future Strategies

My approach to designing this software involved a combination of understanding the core requirements, analyzing the existing game's functionality, and then translating those into a technical design. I focused on creating a **modular architecture** that could support multiple platforms and handle the unique constraints like single game instances and unique naming.

In the future, to analyze and design a similar software application, I would continue to use a structured approach starting with in-depth requirements gathering and analysis. I would place an even stronger emphasis on **user stories and use cases** to capture the nuances of user interaction. I would also consider employing prototyping earlier in the process, particularly for the user interface, to gather feedback and validate design decisions before committing to full-scale development. Utilizing modeling languages like UML for various diagrams (class, sequence, etc.) would remain a key strategy for visualizing and communicating the design.
